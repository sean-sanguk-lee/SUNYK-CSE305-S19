# CSE305 Final Project Assignment

## 1. Introduction
This website is created for the final project assignment of Spring 2019 CSE305: Principles of Database Systems @ SUNY Korea, taught by our beloved Professor [Arthur Lee](https://sunyk.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/ArthurLee-0). The grading criteria was 1. how well the database is created and 2. PHP programming. Our team TeamGiveUsA created a prototype website for a startup called Eatogether.

### [Eatogether](https://eatogether.kr/ko/%ED%99%88/)
... is a one-person food delivery service startup in Songdo, South Korea. While current food delivery services in Korea require a minimum cost to proceed an order, Eatogether provides a food delivery experience with no minimum cost and a delivery fee.

### 1.1 Project Setup
To run a project, please see the section 5 (User's Manual) of this [this document](https://github.com/sean-sanguk-lee/SUNYK-CSE305-S19/blob/master/CSE305_Final_Project-Final_Report_TeamGiveUsA.docx) for a detailed instruction.

### 1.2 The Database
Please refer to the section 3 and 4 of [final report document](https://github.com/sean-sanguk-lee/SUNYK-CSE305-S19/blob/master/CSE305_Final_Project-Final_Report_TeamGiveUsA.docx).

## 2. Major Functionality
### Group Order
Group order functionality removes a minimum cost to proceed an order and minimizes a delivery fee by grouping orders from the same restaurant. The more customer are grouped in a group order the lower the delivery fee, while not required to order excessively for the minimum cost requirement. A customer can either create a group order for other customers to join him, or just join an existing group order. A single group order can only contain menus in the same restaurant. If a sum of the menu prices exceeds a minimum cost to proceed an order of the restaurant, a group order can be proceeded.
